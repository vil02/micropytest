# microPyTest

**microPyTest** is a minimal, pure python-based test runner that you can use directly in code.

## Key Points

- **Code-first approach**: Import and run tests from your own scripts.
- **Artifact tracking**: Each test can record artifacts (files or data) via a built-in **test context**.
- **Command execution**: Run and interact with external processes with real-time output processing.
- **Test filtering**: Run only the tests you need by specifying patterns.
- **Test arguments**: Pass command-line arguments directly to your tests.
- **Lightweight**: Just Python. No special config or advanced fixtures.
- **Optional CLI**: You can also run tests via the `micropytest` command, but **embedding** in your own code is the primary focus.


## Installation

Install directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/micropytest/):

```bash
pip install micropytest
```

## Usage in Code

Suppose you have some test files under `my_tests/`:

```python
# my_tests/test_example.py
def test_basic():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2

def test_with_context(ctx):
    ctx.debug("Starting test_with_context")
    assert 2 + 2 == 4
    ctx.add_artifact("numbers", {"lhs": 2, "rhs": 2})
```

You can **run** them from a Python script:

```python
import micropytest.core

results = micropytest.core.run_tests(tests_path="my_tests")
passed = sum(r.status == "pass" for r in results)
total = len(results)
print(f"Test run complete: {passed}/{total} passed")
```

- Each test that accepts a `ctx` parameter gets a **TestContext** object with `.debug()`, `.warn()`, `.add_artifact()`, etc.
- Results include logs, artifacts, pass/fail/skip status, and **duration**.

## Command Execution

microPyTest includes a `Command` class for running and interacting with external processes:

```python
from micropytest.command import Command
import sys

def test_interactive_command(ctx):
    # Run a Python interpreter interactively
    with Command([sys.executable, "-i"]) as cmd:
        # Send a command
        cmd.write("print('Hello, world!')\n")
        
        # Check the output
        stdout = cmd.get_stdout()
        
        # Exit the interpreter
        cmd.write("exit()\n")
    
    # Verify the output
    assert any("Hello, world!" in line for line in cmd.get_stdout())
```

Key features:
- Run commands with callbacks for real-time output processing
- Interact with processes via stdin
- Access stdout/stderr at any point during execution
- Set custom environment variables and working directories

## Test Filtering

You can run a subset of tests by specifying a filter pattern:

```python
# Run only tests with "artifact" in their name
results = micropytest.core.run_tests(tests_path="my_tests", test_filter="artifact")
```

This is especially useful when you're focusing on a specific area of your codebase.

## Passing Arguments to Tests

Tests can accept and parse command-line arguments using standard Python's `argparse`:

```python
def test_with_args(ctx):
    import argparse
    
    # Create parser
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Test with arguments")
    parser.add_argument("--string", "-s", default="default string", help="Input string")
    parser.add_argument("--number", "-n", type=int, default=0, help="Input number")
    
    # Parse arguments (ignoring unknown args)
    args, _ = parser.parse_known_args()
    
    # Log the parsed arguments
    ctx.debug(f"Parsed arguments:")
    for key, value in vars(args).items():
        ctx.debug(f"  {key}: {value}")
    
    # Use the arguments in your test
    assert args.string != "", "String should not be empty"
    assert args.number >= 0, "Number should be non-negative"
```

When running from the command line, you can pass these arguments directly:

```bash
micropytest --test test_with_args --string="Hello World" --number=42
```

The arguments after your test filter will be passed to your test functions, allowing for flexible test parameterization.

## Differences from pyTest

- **Code-first**: You typically call `run_tests(...)` from Python scripts. The CLI is optional if you prefer it.

- **Artifact handling is built-in**: `ctx.add_artifact("some_key", value)` can store data for later review. No extra plugin required.

- **Command execution built-in**: No need for external plugins to run and interact with processes.

- **No fixtures or plugins**: microPyTest is intentionally minimal. Tests can still share state by passing a custom context class if needed.

- **No configuration**: There's no `pytest.ini` or `conftest.py`. Just put your test functions in `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`.

- **Time estimates for each test**

## Quickstart

See the examples subfolder

## Optional CLI

If you prefer a command-line flow:

```bash
micropytest -p tests/
```

- `--verbose`: Show all debug logs & artifacts.
- `--quiet`: Only prints a final summary.
- `--test`: Run only tests matching the specified pattern.
- `--dry-run`: Show what tests would be run without actually running them (will assume them to pass).

Examples:

```bash
# Run all tests in my_tests directory
micropytest -v my_tests

# Run only tests with "artifact" in their name
micropytest -t artifact my_tests

# Run a specific test and pass arguments to it
micropytest -t test_cmdline_parser --string="Hello" --number=42
```

## Development

To develop with microPyTest, install the required dependencies and run the tests in the project:

```bash
pip install rich
python -m micropytest .
```

### Uploading to PyPI

To build and upload a new version to PyPI:

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Build the distribution packages
python -m build

# Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/micropytest-xxx.tar.gz
```

Make sure to update the version number in `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml` before building a new release.
